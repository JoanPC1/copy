            <h1>About The Good Shepherd Home Care, LLC</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Management team</h2>
            <p>We are proud to have been serving our clients in Illinois since we opened our doors in 2011. Prior to this, owner and manager Lorraine Lucas has had long-term caregiving experience in Illinois. Being from a tradition of treating elders as cherished and revered members of the family, Lorraine’s personal dedication to caring for clients as she would her own parents has enabled her and co-owner Irene Gomez (who has a background in medicine and nursing) to build a company that consistently provides high quality home care services.</p>
            <p>We offer home care services in Cook, DuPage, Will, and Lake Counties. When a need arises, we will strive to accommodate anyone who requires service outside these locations.</p>
            <p>The Good Shepherd Home Care, LLC is licensed, bonded and insured.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Our mission</h2>
            <p>We are committed to helping our clients lead dignified, independent lifestyles in the comfort and safety of their own homes. We do this by carefully assessing and fully understanding your individual needs and selectively placing trained personnel to meet these needs.</p>
            <p>Through periodic assessments and open communication with our clients and their families, as well as continuing training and skills updates for our workers, we endeavor to consistently meet high standards of care for our clients.</p>
